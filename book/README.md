# Deploying Web Apps with AWS (WIP)

*Deploying Web Apps with AWS* teaches the fundamentals of deploying web apps with AWS (Amazon Web Services). It couples practical examples with conceptual explanations so that you learn not just how to follow instructions but also what each instruction does and why. Readers will gain expertise using AWS and familiarity with many AWS services by deploying a scalable, reliable and complex web application - a Readability proxy with playlists, RSS, audio playback, and email notifications.

The target audience is software developers who are comfortable with a general purpose programming language like Javascript, Python, or Java. Although the example projects are written using Javascript, familiarity with Javascript is not required because this book focuses on *architecting* and *deploying*, not *coding*, web apps.

This book is not an exhaustive reference of every service offered by AWS. It is a tutorial about deploying web app, and should be read sequentially, as each section assumes familiarity with the concepts explained in prior sections.

Some examples in this book use third party services that are simpler, more feature rich, and/or cheaper than the AWS equivalent. Examples include Gitlab for source control and Lets Encrypt for provisioning SSL certificates.
